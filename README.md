# *** UPDATE ***
Jomres is now ALL Open Source. Even the Jomres Plugin Manager is now Open Source. Never need a Jomres licence to run your website. It will never expire. The ONLY time you would need to get a Jomres Licence is to update the plugins. And for that you will only need a one month license. Or you can download the updated plugin here from free.

This means that you ONLY have to download any of my Jomres Quickstarts and never need to worry that your Jomres website will expire and not work anymore. My Quickstarts are more updated.
